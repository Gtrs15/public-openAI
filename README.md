# OpenAI (Using Text-Davinci-003)
This project demonstrates how to use the OpenAI API to generate natural language text using the Text-Davinci-003 engine. The program prompts the user to input a question, and the Text-Davinci-003 engine generates a response based on the question.

# Installation
1. Clone the repository to a directory of your choosing.
2. Create a new virtual environment using the command: python -m venv venv
3. Activate the virtual environment using the command: source venv/bin/activate
4. Install the openai library using the command: pip install openai
5. Create a new .py file in the project directory and add a variable named KEY. This variable should be set to your OpenAI API key.
6. Obtain an API key from the OpenAI platform by signing up for the free trial. API keys can be created at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys. Note that the free trial does not require a credit card.
7. Once you have added your API key, you can run the ask.py file using the command: python ask.py


# Usage
To use the program, simply run the ask.py file as described above. The program will prompt you to input a question, and the Text-Davinci-003 engine will generate a response based on your input.
